# Handwritten-digit-classifer

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Classifier project! This application leverages the power of machine learning to classify handwritten digits, using a Django web framework for the backend. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can draw a digit on the screen, and the application will predict the digit based on a pre-trained machine learning model.

### Features
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface to draw digits.
Real-Time Prediction: Get instant predictions of your handwritten digits.
Machine Learning: Utilizes a robust machine learning model for accurate digit classification.
Django Backend: A scalable and secure backend powered by Django.
