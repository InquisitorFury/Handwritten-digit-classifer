# Handwritten-digit-classifer

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Classifier project! This application leverages the power of machine learning to classify handwritten digits, using a Django web framework for the backend. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can draw a digit on the screen, and the application will predict the digit based on a pre-trained machine learning model.

### Key Features
Interactive Interface: Users can draw digits directly on a canvas and submit them for classification.
Real-Time Predictions: The application delivers instant predictions based on the drawn digit.
Robust Machine Learning Model: The digit classification is powered by a pre-trained machine learning model, ensuring high accuracy.
Django Backend: Utilizes the Django framework to handle the backend operations, providing a scalable and secure foundation.

### Technical Overview
Frontend: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS,React and JavaScript, offering an intuitive drawing experience.
Backend: Django serves as the backbone of the application, managing user interactions and communicating with the machine learning model.
Machine Learning: The classification model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, ensuring reliable predictions.

### Acknowledgements
The MNIST dataset is publicly available and was used for training the machine learning model.
